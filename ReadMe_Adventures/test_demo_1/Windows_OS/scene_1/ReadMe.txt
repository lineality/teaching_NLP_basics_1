Scene 1: Find Your Friends


Instructions:
1. Open Terminal
2. Get file       wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lineality/teaching_NLP_basics_1/master/ReadMe_Adventures/test_demo_1/Windows_OS/scene_1.py
3. Run file       Command: python3 scene_1.py


(Optional)
Tips:
1. When given a choice or a question,
type in your answer and hit return.

2. Running the .py file will create new files
that you can use during the scene. Look for those files
the directory (folder) that your command terminal is open in.
(This file may be updated as well.)

3. Since it is lying on the bar-counter in front of you,
you can 'access' the inn's guest-register.
Check your file directory again.
(This will help you to answer
the red-nosed innkeeper's question.)
